NOTE: The path to `AuthController.success` is used in `frontendCallbackUrl` in `application.groovy`.

<1> Responds a Cookie with the JWT token as value
<2> Responding a cookie with the same name and `maxAge` equals 0 deletes the cookie. Thus, it logs out the user.
<3> Prevents any Javascript executed in your site ( even your own javascript ) to do `document.cookies` and access the cookies
<4> Cookie won't leave if you do http:// instead of https://. You should use https in production.
<5> Set the cookie expiration to match JWT expiration
<6> Use the same cookie name, the custom `tokenReader` we previoulsy defined expects.

NOTE: Due to the stateless nature of the security solution of this application. To log out a user involves the deletion the cookie containing his JWT token.

The GSP of `success` action performs simple redirect to the home page. We do the redirect in the
client side to ensure the cookie is correctly set.
