From the Twitter Application Management page click `Create New App`

WARNING: Twitter does not accept `localhost` so give it the localhost ip address instead `127.0.0.1`.

Fill out the form with a app name, basic description, your web address, and a callback (where you want Twitter to
return to after you signin). Then click `Create your Twitter application`.

Next select the `Keys and Access Tokens` tab

This is all the setup that needs to be done in Twitter. Save your Consumer Key and Secret for quick access later.
Now we will take a look at setting up our application with our Twitter credentials.
